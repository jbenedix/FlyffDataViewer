# FlyffDataViewer

## Why
I started this tool because i was sick of searching for items / Ids / Names in dozen different files. The existing GM Tools are not up-to-date so this tool looks for the files directoly in the Resource folder of your Server.<br>
It is far from beeing finished but it works for Items and movers so far.<br>

## Settings
In the same folder with the .exe file is a Settings.ini file which contains the resourcePath. Just add the Path to your Ressource Folder (don't add a backslash at the end)<br>
<br>
Following Files are needed (can be changed in ContentManager Load Functions):
- propMover.txt.txt
- propMover.txt
- defineObj.h
- Spec_Item.txt
- propItem.txt.txt
- defineItem.h
